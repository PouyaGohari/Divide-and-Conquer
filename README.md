## Introduction

This repository contains implementations of three different problems solved using the divide-and-conquer algorithmic paradigm. Divide and conquer is a powerful strategy for solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- You have installed the latest version of C++ (or the relevant programming language).
- You have a basic understanding of divide-and-conquer algorithms.

## Installation

To clone and run this repository locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/PouyaGohari/Divide-and-Conquer.git
1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   cd Divide-and-Conquer

## Usage
To compile and run the algorithms, use the following commands 
1. Compile the code:
   ```sh
   g++ -o output_file source_file.cpp
2. Run the executable:
   ```sh
   ./output_file
Replace output_file with the name you want for the compiled file and source_file.cpp with the name of the source file you want to compile.
